		<h1>Design elements with justification</h1> <br> <br>
 
		<h5><strong>Home page</strong></h5><br> 
 
 <p>Wherever you will click on, our x movement logo will stay in the left corner. This is because we want our create brand recognition and awareness. Our logo is important to recognize and create a community. Next to the logo, on the right, you will see a ‘facebook’, ‘Instagram’ and a ‘shopping bag’ button. We created the facebook button, so it will be easier for the customers to find our facebook account which links back to our marketing plan. The same goes for the Instagram link. Lastly, you can click on the shopping basket, if the customer wants to pay. </p><br><br> 
 
<p>The navigation bar is divided in four sections, ‘Home’, ‘Catalog’, ‘About us’, and ‘Contact us’.  We made this navigation bar, because these four are the most important pages for our website and has to be easy to find for the customer. We made this bar in green, the stand our more and will be more striking in this way. Also, in green, it will not blend in with the top white buttons.</p><br>
 
 
<p>Home: when clicking on this page, you will go directly to the home page. On this page, there will be a carousel with pictures of people wearing our gender-neutral clothing, so the customer can see immediately how it fits and what offer we have.  On the right, we have a text with our story. Here, we will explain quickly who we are, where we stand for, a short instruction for our website and other helpful information that the customer needs to know before shopping. We made this text in a yellow box, to stand out and catch the attention.</p><br>
 
<p>Catalog: This is the page where our website will be founded. There is an option with ‘show all’, but you can also categorize based on the items (shoes, shirts, basics, etc.). There will be boxes for the items with a picture, item name, price and sizes. In this way, the customer can scroll through the catalog and read the most important thing about the item, without having to click on it. You can click on the item, to read more important information, such as washing instructions and fabric material, but you can also put it in your cart immediately. </p><br> 
 
<p>About us: When you hang your cursor on the ‘about us’, the options ‘meet the team and our values’ will be visible, which you can click on and this will lead you to these pages. On the ‘about us’ page, we will discuss our brand, how we started, were we are now and what we want in the future.  </p><br>
 
<p>Meet the team: On this page, we will introduce ourselves, with pictures of each of us. It is really important for the customer to get to know us, because in this way we can create a small relationship and reliability with the customer. For the text, we made boxes in different colours (based on our colour palette), for each person. We used all colours to make this page a bit playful, because here we will tell fun stories and not so serious topics about ourselves.</p>
 
<p>Contact us: On this page, the customer can get in contact with us. The first and last name, email, country and subject is needed for this. In this way, we can easily email the customer back with out respond.</p><br>
 
<p>FAQ: We also created a frequently asked questions page, where all the most asked questions will be discussed and explained. The questions will be underneath each other, and when clicking on the question, a big, pink box with the answer will appear. This page can be found at the bottom on the page. This is important, because when the customer has a question, the customer can first look in the FAQ page, before having to ask the question him/herself. This will save a lot of time and inconvenience.</p><br>

The colours from our colour palette are: #E873A5, #7CC17B, #0E0F0F, #3EA3E9, and #F2E58E. The pink and the blue colours are based on the gender-neutral flag, which is applicable for our brand vision. We are also using green and yellow colours, because these are also gender neutral colours. Also, we have a black shade, because this is a neutral colour and easy to work with. All the colours (except from the black) are pastel/soft colours, because we are a calm and friendly brand and don’t want to overwhelm people. <br><br>
 
Choice of fonts from Google Fonts<br>
 
The font we are using is Gotu. This font is a little bit childish, playful, not straight and not perfect, and that is exactly where we stand for: having freedom and be whoever you are, you don’t have to be perfect. Also, this is a font which you don’t see often, and with this we want to build brand recognition and awareness. </p>
